1. (10 pts.) In general, the probability that it rains on Saturday is 25%. Weekend rain has the following relationships: • If it rains on Saturday, the probability that it rains on Sunday is 50%. • If it does not rain on Saturday, the probability that it rains on Sunday is 25%. Given that it rained on Sunday, what is the probability that it rained on Saturday?
2. (20 pts.) A bug stands on a random point of the lattice below. Each point is equally likely to be the starting point.
Every minute, the bug selects an adjacent point at random and moves to it. Each adjacent point is equally likely to be chosen. For example, if the bug is on point B, then each probability to move to the points A, C, or G is 1 3. What is the probability that the bug reaches point A in 2 moves or less? Each point is equally likely to be the bug’s starting point. Also, assume starting at A will ”reach” the point in 0 moves.
3. (40 pts.) The idea for the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is to ﬁnd the value of the parameter(s) for which the data has the highest probability. You are going to do this with the densities. Suppose the 1-dimension data points x1,x2,…xn given in ”data.txt” ﬁle are drawn from a normal(gauss) N(µ,σ2) distribution, where µ and σ are unknown. • (20 pts.) Formulate the likelihood function and derive the equation to ﬁnd the maximum likelihood estimate for the pair (µ,σ2). • (20 pts.) Implement (write the code) MLE in Matlab or Python language and provide your plot that is similar to Figure 1. You are not allowed use any built-in functions except histogram functions to provide you a quick of the distribution of the data.

4. (30 pts.) In the Table 1 below, x1 x1 x1, x2 x2 x2, x3 x3 x3 and xi xi xi ∈{0,1}, i = 1,2,3. xi xi xi represent the i feature vector and y y y ∈{+,−} represents the class label. (a) (15 pts.) Construct the Naive Bayes classiﬁer for the given training dataset in Table 1. Hint: Estimate the class conditional prob. for each feature vector x1 x1 x1, x2 x2 x2, x3 x3 x3 (b) (5 pts.) Predict the class label for (x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1) data using trained Naive Bayes approach in part (a) (c) (10 pts.) Calculate the probabilities of P(x1 = 1), P(x2 = 1), and P(x1 = 1,x2 = 1). Decide whether x1 and x2 are independent or not.
